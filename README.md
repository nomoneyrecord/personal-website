Summary

I have dabbled in coding and development over the years and up until 2021, I decided to take the leap into tech by learning full stack development. After experimenting with multiple languages, I decided to utilize a mentorship program that would help guide and develop my skills to an employable level. 

This website is the first of my projects in the program which displays a general understanding of HTML, CSS, and learning how to deploy best practices. I can say that I had some confusion at first with understanding these languages, but after this project I am grasping the concepts far more efficiently.
